### A Cowardly Test-o-phobe's Guide To Test-Driven Development With iOS
### S10 Train Times

#### Being an example from a presentation given at iOSCon London, May 2014

This example demonstrates the use of OHHTTPStubs to simulate a network connection.

The app puports to retrieve the time of the next S10 train between Uitikon Waldegg and ZÃ¼rich Hauptbahnhof.  In normal circumstances, this data would be available through the magic of the transport.opendata.ch API.

In this example, the network request is mocked out by OHHTTPStubs, and loads the data from a JSON file in the app bundle.  It also simulates a slow network response to force the activity indicator to turn red (indicating a long-running request).
